The repository releases teaching material for an educational module on computational wind engineering (CWE) with a focus on the use of LES for wind loading calculation. The module takes about 150 minutes to teach and provides a basic introduction to the use of LES for wind load calculations. There are 5 slide decks, provided in .ppt and .pdf format. These slides can be used by the instructor during class time. Alternatively, a series of short 10-15 minute videos are available, covering the material in the slides.


Slide decks are intended to be taught in the following order:

- CWEModule_Intro: introduction to the module, covering motivation, learning goals and an overview of the module
  
- CWEModule_PartI: covers the basic flow physics of interest, the quantities of interest, and the geometrical model
  
- CWEModule_PartII: covers the governing equations and boundary conditions (i.e., the mathematical model)
  
- CWEModule_PartIII: covers basics concepts in discretization and solution methods (i.e., the discretized model)
  
- CWEModule_PartIV: covers analysis of the results, including verification, validation, and quality assurance
